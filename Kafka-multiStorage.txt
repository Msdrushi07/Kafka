Perfect 👍 now let’s extend the DROID-style multi-storage fan-out:

📌 One Kafka event (TradeEvent) → 3 different storages

Oracle (transactional storage – source of truth)

Elasticsearch (fast search)

S3 (raw event archival)



---

🔹 Flow

1. Producer sends TradeEvent → Kafka topic (trade-events).


2. DROID consumer(s) subscribe.


3. Storage services write data to:

Oracle (with @Transactional)

Elasticsearch (via Spring Data ES / REST client)

S3 (via AWS SDK).





---

🔹 1. Oracle (Transactional Storage)

We already built this ✅ in previous step:

@Service
public class TradeStorageService {
    private final TradeRepository tradeRepository;
    private final SettlementRepository settlementRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void storeEvent(TradeEvent event) {
        Trade trade = new Trade();
        trade.setTradeId(event.getTradeId());
        trade.setAmount(event.getAmount());
        trade.setStatus("BOOKED");

        Settlement settlement = new Settlement();
        settlement.setSettlementId(event.getSettlementId());
        settlement.setTradeId(event.getTradeId());
        settlement.setStatus(event.getSettlementStatus());

        tradeRepository.save(trade);

        if ("FAIL".equals(event.getSettlementStatus())) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Settlement failed!");
        }

        settlementRepository.save(settlement);
    }
}


---

🔹 2. Elasticsearch Storage

We keep a lightweight index copy of the trade for searching.

import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.annotations.Document;

@Document(indexName = "trades")
public class TradeIndex {
    @Id
    private String tradeId;
    private Double amount;
    private String settlementStatus;
    // getters/setters
}

Repository:

public interface TradeIndexRepository extends ElasticsearchRepository<TradeIndex, String> {}

Service:

@Service
public class ElasticsearchStorageService {

    private final TradeIndexRepository tradeIndexRepository;

    public ElasticsearchStorageService(TradeIndexRepository repo) {
        this.tradeIndexRepository = repo;
    }

    public void indexEvent(TradeEvent event) {
        TradeIndex doc = new TradeIndex();
        doc.setTradeId(event.getTradeId());
        doc.setAmount(event.getAmount());
        doc.setSettlementStatus(event.getSettlementStatus());
        tradeIndexRepository.save(doc);
    }
}


---

🔹 3. S3 Storage (Raw Avro Event Archival)

Here we dump the raw JSON/Avro event for audit/compliance.

import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ObjectMetadata;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

@Service
public class S3StorageService {
    private final AmazonS3 s3Client;
    private final String bucketName = "droid-trades-archive";

    public S3StorageService(AmazonS3 s3Client) {
        this.s3Client = s3Client;
    }

    public void archiveEvent(TradeEvent event) {
        String key = "trades/" + event.getTradeId() + ".json";
        String content = event.toString(); // or use Jackson to serialize JSON

        ObjectMetadata metadata = new ObjectMetadata();
        metadata.setContentLength(content.length());

        s3Client.putObject(bucketName, key,
                new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(content.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)),
                metadata);
    }
}


---

🔹 4. Orchestration (Kafka Consumer)

Now our DROID consumer calls all 3 storages.

@Service
public class TradeConsumer {

    private final TradeStorageService oracleStorage;
    private final ElasticsearchStorageService esStorage;
    private final S3StorageService s3Storage;

    public TradeConsumer(TradeStorageService oracleStorage,
                         ElasticsearchStorageService esStorage,
                         S3StorageService s3Storage) {
        this.oracleStorage = oracleStorage;
        this.esStorage = esStorage;
        this.s3Storage = s3Storage;
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "trade-events", groupId = "droid-consumer")
    public void consume(TradeEvent event) {
        try {
            // ✅ 1. Save in Oracle with transaction
            oracleStorage.storeEvent(event);

            // ✅ 2. Index into Elasticsearch
            esStorage.indexEvent(event);

            // ✅ 3. Archive raw event into S3
            s3Storage.archiveEvent(event);

            System.out.println("Stored in Oracle, ES, and archived in S3: " + event.getTradeId());

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing event " + event.getTradeId() + ": " + e.getMessage());
            // Could send to DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) for retry
        }
    }
}


---

🔹 Key Points

Oracle → Transactional (source of truth, strong consistency).

Elasticsearch → Fast search & analytics (eventually consistent).

S3 → Cheap, durable archive for raw events.


👉 Same event is not duplicated manually by producer — instead, Kafka allows multiple consumers (Oracle/ES/S3 services).


---

⚖️ In a real DROID system:

Oracle consumer might run in transactional mode.

Elasticsearch consumer might run asynchronously (eventually consistent).

S3 archival consumer might batch events for cost savings.



---

Would you like me to also show this with multiple consumer groups (one group for Oracle, one for ES, one for S3) instead of a single consumer calling all 3? This is how DROID achieves true decoupling.

Great 👍 now let’s move from the single consumer calling all 3 storages → to the real-world decoupled pattern with multiple consumer groups.

This is how DROID achieves scalability + loose coupling.


---

🔹 Why Multiple Consumer Groups?

Oracle consumer group → ensures strong transactional consistency.

Elasticsearch consumer group → can fail/retry independently, doesn’t affect Oracle.

S3 consumer group → can archive events at its own pace.


📌 Same Kafka topic (trade-events) → 3 different consumer groups.
Each consumer group has its own offset tracking, so they work independently.


---

🔹 Flow

Producer → Kafka topic: trade-events
          ↙           ↓           ↘
   Consumer Group 1   Consumer Group 2   Consumer Group 3
   (Oracle Service)  (Elasticsearch)    (S3 Archival)


---

🔹 1. Oracle Consumer

@Service
public class OracleConsumer {

    private final TradeStorageService oracleStorage;

    public OracleConsumer(TradeStorageService oracleStorage) {
        this.oracleStorage = oracleStorage;
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "trade-events", groupId = "oracle-consumer")
    public void consume(TradeEvent event) {
        try {
            oracleStorage.storeEvent(event);
            System.out.println("Stored in Oracle: " + event.getTradeId());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Oracle write failed: " + e.getMessage());
            // Send to DLQ or retry
        }
    }
}


---

🔹 2. Elasticsearch Consumer

@Service
public class ElasticsearchConsumer {

    private final ElasticsearchStorageService esStorage;

    public ElasticsearchConsumer(ElasticsearchStorageService esStorage) {
        this.esStorage = esStorage;
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "trade-events", groupId = "elasticsearch-consumer")
    public void consume(TradeEvent event) {
        try {
            esStorage.indexEvent(event);
            System.out.println("Indexed in Elasticsearch: " + event.getTradeId());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("ES indexing failed: " + e.getMessage());
            // Optionally retry / DLQ
        }
    }
}


---

🔹 3. S3 Consumer

@Service
public class S3Consumer {

    private final S3StorageService s3Storage;

    public S3Consumer(S3StorageService s3Storage) {
        this.s3Storage = s3Storage;
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "trade-events", groupId = "s3-consumer")
    public void consume(TradeEvent event) {
        try {
            s3Storage.archiveEvent(event);
            System.out.println("Archived to S3: " + event.getTradeId());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("S3 archival failed: " + e.getMessage());
            // Could retry later / batch store
        }
    }
}


---

🔹 Key Differences (Single Consumer vs Multi-Group)

Pattern	Pros	Cons

Single Consumer calling all 3	Simple to implement, single transaction boundary	If ES/S3 fails, Oracle write may also get delayed/blocked
Multiple Consumer Groups ✅ (real-world DROID)	Decoupled, scalable independently, one failure doesn’t affect others	More infra (3 services), eventual consistency (ES/S3 may lag behind Oracle)



---

🔹 Example Timeline

1. Producer sends TradeEvent (T123).


2. Oracle consumer commits immediately → ✅ strong consistency.


3. Elasticsearch consumer may index later (async) → searchable within seconds.


4. S3 consumer archives raw Avro → available for compliance.



So, Oracle is source of truth, while ES + S3 are eventually consistent copies.


---

⚖️ This is exactly why you saw earlier that the same data exists in 3 storages — but the role of each storage is different.


---

👉 Rushi, do you want me to now also show you how to configure Kafka consumer groups in application.yml so that Oracle, ES, and S3 consumers run completely independently?
